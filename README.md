# PCOD_SQL_PowerBI_Analysis
This project analyzes a clinical dataset of 500 PCOD patients to uncover insights related to risk categorization, treatment adherence, and follow-up behavior using SQL and Power BI.

## Files in this Repository
•⁠  ⁠⁠ PCOD_SQL Dataset.csv ⁠ – Cleaned dataset for SQL analysis
•⁠  ⁠⁠ PCOD_Analysis_Queries.sql ⁠ – SQL logic for risk flagging, trends, stratification
•⁠  ⁠⁠ queries_and_docs.md ⁠ – Full documentation, report, visuals guide
•⁠  ⁠⁠ PCOD_Dashboard.pbix ⁠ – Power BI file (to be added after dashboard creation)

## Tools
SQL • Power BI • Excel • DAX • Python (data generation)

## Analysis Highlights
•⁠  ⁠Stratify patients by PCOD risk based on BMI, androgen, and insulin resistance
•⁠  ⁠Track missed follow-ups by provider
•⁠  ⁠Evaluate treatment adherence by risk group

## Dashboard Features
•⁠  ⁠Risk Distribution Chart
•⁠  ⁠Adherence Breakdown
•⁠  ⁠Follow-up Trends by OB/GYN
•⁠  ⁠Interactive Filters (age, symptoms, provider)
